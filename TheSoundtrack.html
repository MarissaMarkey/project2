		Dear Evan Hansen has an amazing soundtrack that was written by Justin Paul and Benj Pasek. It consists of 14 songs, that each play a very important role in telling Evan's story.
		The reason I became very interested in Dear Evan Hansen is because I heard the song in a commercial, and then became completely obsessed with the soundtrack. There are sad songs, 
		and very uplifting songs, but the one thing that is for sure, is that there is a song for everyone on this soundtrack. Below, are my top 5 songs from Dear Evan Hansen.

			"Waving Through a Window", was the first song I heard and it was the first song released by the play. This song has been my favorite ever since I heard about the play. I love the song "You Will Be Found" because the music in the background 
			is written beautifully, and the lyrics can make me feel better whenever I am feeling down. "Good For You" is a upbeat song, and I like it because it is super catchy. "Sincerly Me" is a song when Evan and Jermey are writing fake emails. It is my
			forth favorite song, because it is catchy and funny. Lastly, "For Forever" is an amazing song just because it is very pretty and relaxing.
