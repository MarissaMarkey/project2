		Like I have mentioned before, Dear Evan Hansen is an amazing play. I recently saw it on it’s National tour at the Ahmanson theater in Los Angeles. It is preformed
		with a different cast, because there is a whole new cast for the National tour, but it was still good.It was actually incredible, and it was amazing to see the story I had read and listened to actually come to life.
		<br></br>
		Dear Evan Hansen was written by Steven Levenson. This play is about a boy named Evan Hansen who struggles with a social anxiety disorder. He writes letter to himself to tell him why each day is going to be good. 
		This play is about a boy named Evan Hansen who struggles with a social anxiety disorder. He writes letter to himself to tell him why each day is going to be good. 
		It always starts with “Today is going to be a good day and here’s why.” This letter ends up in the hands of Connor Murphy, who is an outcast just like Evan. However 
		when Conner kills himself, the family of Connor begins to think that Evan and Connor were best friends. Evan doesn’t want to lie, but the Murphy’s find so much 
		comfort in knowing the Connor had a friend. Plus, Evan is finally able to make connections with other people and even has a chance of being with his crush Zoe Murphy (Connor’s sister).

	This seems like a very sad story, and I’m not saying you won’t shed some tears (you definitely will), but it is also very uplifting. The play can really help you see that you are not alone, and there is always a way to get through struggles in
	your life. Steven Levenson wrote Dear Evan Hansen very well. It has a total of 6 Tony's and has been preformed all over the country. It has a perfect mixture of humorous and emotional parts. While watching the play, you feel like you are living in Evan's world and the actors/actresses are able to make you feel what 
	they are feeling. I was really amazed by how well the characters were portrayed, and how realistic everything felt. I also really liked that the cast was very small, and that most of the set was created using technology. For most of the play, the 
	background is just images on screens. It is something that makes Dear Evan Hansen very unique. 
	<br></br>
	My only complaint was the relationship between Zoe and Evan seems kind of unrealistic. It think more time could have been spent on their relationship, and them getting to know each other. I just found it hard to believe that Zoe would fall for Evan 
	in such a short amount of time. This was the only part of the play that didn't feel like it was happening in real life. 
	<br></br>
	Not only is it a great play it is also written in the form of a screenplay and a novel. The novel was written by Val Emmich and it gives a lot of details that you wouldn’t hear about in the play. 
	I loved learning more about Connors and Evan’s life. You can also read the screenplay which was definitely worth reading. It almost lets you watch the play, just without the actors and actresses. Both of these are 
	great option if you can’t actually see the play.
